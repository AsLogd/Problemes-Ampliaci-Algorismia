\subsection{Enunciat}
Linear Diophantine equations. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be natural numbers. Show that the linear equation
\[
ax + by = c
\]
has integer solutions $x$ and $y$ if and only if $gcd(a,b)$ divides $c$, and that it has either zero or infinitely many integer solutions. Then give a polynomial time algorithm that returns a solution $(x,y)$ where the integers $x,y \geq 0$ or reports that no such solution exists.
