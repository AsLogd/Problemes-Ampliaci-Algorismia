\subsection{Enunciat}
\textbf{When both minimizing and maximizing are easy ...} This does not mean that deciding the existence of a solution in a given interval is easy. Recall that the problem of computing a MINIMUM SPANNING TREE can be solved by a polynomial time greedy algorithm. The same strategy also works for the MAXIMUM SPANNING TREE, so both the extremal versions of the spanning tree problem are in P. The following EXACT SPANNING TREE problem asks for a spanning tree whose weight is in a given interval, somewhere between these extremes:

\textit{Input}: A weighted graph $G$ and two integers $l$ and $u$. 

\textit{Question}: Is there a spanning tree $T$ with weight $w$ such that $l \leq w \leq u$?

\vspace{5mm}
It’s not clear how to generalize the greedy algorithm to EXACT SPANNING TREE. In fact, there is probably no polynomial time algorithm at all, because EXACT SPANNING TREE is NP-complete. Show that EXACT SPANNING TREE is NP-complete
