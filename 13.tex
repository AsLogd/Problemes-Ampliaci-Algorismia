\section{Problema 13}
\subsection{Enunciat}
The \textbf{Set Packing problem} is defined as follows: 
\newline 
Given a family of sets $S_1,...,S_m \subseteq U$ such that, for $1 \leq i \leq m$, $|S_i| = 3$ and has profit $c(S_i)$, find a subset of these sets that maximizes the profit, while each element is covered at most once. Provide a integer linear programming formulation for the problem.
\subsection{Soluci√≥}
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \text{maximize }   & \sum_{j=1}^m c(S_j)x_j  \\
    \text{subject to } & \sum_{\forall_j:v \in S_j}^m x_j \ \leq 1,\ \forall_{v \in U}\\
                       & x_j = \{0,1\},\  1\leq j\leq m
\end{alignat*}
$x_j$: Set $j$ is selected.
