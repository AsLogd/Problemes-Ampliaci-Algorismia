\subsection{Enunciat}
\textbf{Node hubs.} The students of the MEI PTDMA course have to design an algorithm to provide a list of contacts pointing to a strong influential group in a social network. To pass the course it is enough to design an App that identifies a smallest \textit{node hub} in the social network. A \textit{node hub} is a subset of participants whose removal leaves a \textit{fully} connected vertex subset. For this exercise you can assume that the social network is an undirected connected graph and
that a vertex subset $X$ is \textit{fully connected} if and only if, for every pair of distinct vertices in $X$, either they are connected by an edge or they are both connected by an edge to a third vertex in $X$.


(a) Design a constant factor approximation algorithm for the problem. Justify its correctness and efficiency. 

(b) Prove that the decision version of the problem when parameterized by the size of the node hub belongs to FPT
